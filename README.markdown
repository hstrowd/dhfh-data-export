Exports and converts the data captured in the site's forms into separate CSV files that are able to be imported into the Dupage Habitat for Humanity's Raiser's Edge database.

Description 
==============

This plugin is designed for use by DuPage Habitat for Humanity to export data from a wordpress site in a format that can be imported into a Blackbaud Raiser's Edge database. The data is stored in wordpress by the Visual Form Builder plugin and must be tranformed in order to be acceptable by Raiser's Edge.

The use case for the logic implemented in this plugin is very narrow, but the larger concept of being able to export data and transform it at the same time is widely applicable.
